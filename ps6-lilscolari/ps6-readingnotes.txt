Chapter 18 Reading Notes:
- Inheritance: define a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.
- To define a new class that inherits from an existing class, you put the name of the existing class in parentheses
- A class diagram is a more abstract representation of the structure of a program.
- Shows individual objects and the relationship between them.
- Encode: To represent one set of values using another set of values by constructing a mapping between them.
- Class attribute: An attribute associated with a class object. Class attributes are defined inside a class definition but outside any method.
- Instance attribute: An attribute associated with an instance of a class
- Veneer: A method or function that provides a different interface to another function without doing much computation.
- Parent Class(Superclass): The class from which a child class inherits
- Child Class(Sub-class): A new class created by inheriting from an existing class
- IS-A Relationship: A relationship between a child class and its parent class
- HAS-A Relationship: A relationship between two classes where instances of one class contain references to instances of the other
- Dependency: A relationship between two classes where instances of one class use instances of the other class, but do not store them as attributes
- Multiplicity: A notation in a class diagram that shows, for a HAS-A relationship, how many references there are to instances of another class
- Data Encapsulation: A program development plan that involves a prototype using global variables and a final version that makes the global variables into instance attributes
